No, this is not true.  Enforcement of laws are at the discretion of the executive branch.  I am sure there are laws in your state (and at the federal level) that are not enforced anymore.

CJC writes as though the law is a just law.   Why?    He claims that it is Congress' job to change laws but the Current Republican Congress is unable to do that.     Sometimes the people of the USA have to fix things.     At the end of prohibition states began to legalize alcohol when it became obvious Prohibition had failed.    Eventually Congress got around to repealing Prohibition from the Constitution, but they certainly never led its repeal.    It appears that none of them had the political courage to admit its failure.    The same thing is going on now.    The political weasels will continue to put Americans in prison until the American people shut them down.
