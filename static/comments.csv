102,4JOUO2FRM5ATUNBFCFMNW2XC6A,David,It is up to Congress to change the law and is not at the whim of a President to sign an executive order changing the law.  What Obama did was illegal in not upholding the CURRENT laws of the United States.  If you don't like a law you don't have your Attorney General or DOJ stop enforcing the law.  Congress will need to lead in this case and Senator Booker why don't you lead instead of attacking from the sidelines.,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,

If they exported it to other states he is correct.  This is a 10th amendment issue, not a federal issue as no state lines are crossed here.  The people of each state passed this and it is not a federal jurisdiction issue.
