But NO ONE watches these sales, NO ONE hold these sellers accountable, and because of this, it spreads to become recreational use also.  I watched my neighbors son, who was a great athlete in high school, a very good student, and an outgoing, friendly young man, to getting involved with the wrong people and becoming hooked on weed.  He lost his job, lost his interest in life, gained 75 lbs and became a recluse.  His relationship with his family suffered greatly and was on a terrible downward spiral.  The family had a young Minister come to talk to him, and that was his start for recovery.  I am happy to say the young man is about 80% recovered and is doing better each year.  He is now 34 and has wasted over 10 years because of weed, pot, marijuana  .  Don't anyone tell me that pot, weed, marijuana does not destroy lives.",NEGATIVE,1,5,0,3,Recommended by bot,
